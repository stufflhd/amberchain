Hello,

Here are the endpoints for authentication:

Login
https://wapp.amberchains.com/api/public/signin

Sign up
https://wapp.amberchains.com/api/public/signup

Email validation
https://wapp.amberchains.com/auth/validate-mail

Some information regarding the current profile validation process:

1. User Registration

Users register on the website.

Their status is set to "WAITING_FOR_MAIL_CONFIRMATION".
They are then redirected to a page (or the same page) indicating that a confirmation email has been sent.

If a user tries to log in before confirming their email,
the site will display a message inviting them to confirm their email (with the option to resend the confirmation email).

2. Email Validation

When the user clicks the validation link in the email, they are redirected to the site to complete their profile.

Their status is updated to "INCOMPLETE_PROFILE".

The user will not have access to any pages except their profile page until the profile is activated.

Certain information will be required before the profile can be activated (we’ll define those details later).

3. Profile Review

After the user completes their profile, the site displays a message indicating that the profile is under review.

Once approved, the user's status is updated to "ACTIVE",
and they gain access to all user pages (an email will be sent to inform them that their account is now active).

I’m attaching the swagger.json file;
you can use it in a Swagger editor to see all the necessary data for the endpoints.
